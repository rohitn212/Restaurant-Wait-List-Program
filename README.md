# Restaurant-Wait-List-Program
A program that mimics the wait list for a restaurant that I wrote for a school project. You're in charge of a restaurant that has a wait list for it's customers. Customers are given an option of either calling in to place themselves in the waitlist or directly waiting in the restaurant. 

This project taught me how to break a program down into separate modules as well as how a data structure such as a priority queue can be implemented in real life. 

Download the files and run the makefile to run the program. The program requires no input files since you can use any of the commands such as add a group, display the list, etc.
